// Solution 1: Verify and Correct Native Module Configuration
// Ensure that your app.json and package.json files accurately reflect all native dependencies and configurations.
// Example: if you are using react-native-camera, make sure it is correctly listed in both app.json and package.json, with the correct versions.

// Solution 2: Check Dependency Versions
// Manually verify all dependency versions.  Version mismatches or incompatible packages are common causes of errors.
// Consider using a tool like npm-check-updates to identify outdated packages.

// Solution 3: Clean and Rebuild
// Sometimes, cached build files can interfere with the build process.  Try cleaning and rebuilding your project:
//    expo prebuild --clean
//    expo run:android or expo run:ios 

// Solution 4: Review Native Code Implementation
// If you're working with custom native modules, carefully check the native code for any errors or inconsistencies. Verify that it is properly integrated with your React Native app.

// Solution 5: Check Expo SDK Version
// Ensure you're using a compatible Expo SDK version. Outdated or incompatible versions can trigger build issues.

// Solution 6:  Expo Upgrade
//   expo upgrade

// Solution 7: Expo Doctor
// Run expo doctor to check for potential problems in your project setup.

// Solution 8:  Simplify or isolate the native module:
// Create a minimal project with only your native module to isolate the problem. This helps in diagnosing if the problem is linked to your custom module or other factors.

// Solution 9: Consult Expo Forums and Documentation
// If the problem persists, consult the Expo forums and documentation for additional troubleshooting guidance.
