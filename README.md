# Expo Managed Workflow: Uncommon Native Module Build Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Expo's managed workflow with native modules. The issue involves vague error messages during the build process, making debugging challenging. This bug can manifest in various ways, including:

* Build failures.
* Runtime crashes.
* Unexpected application behavior.
* Errors indicating missing native libraries or linking issues.

The solution provided addresses potential causes of the problem, offering various strategies to resolve conflicts and ensure smooth build processes.

## Bug Description

The bug arises from inconsistencies between the Expo Go app, Expo CLI, and the native code (Android/iOS). This may be due to issues in native module configuration (`app.json`, `package.json`), dependency version mismatches, problems in the native code implementation, or Expo build system issues.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Try to run the app with Expo Go or build it for a specific platform using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`. 
4. Observe the build errors or runtime crashes.
