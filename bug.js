This bug occurs when using the Expo managed workflow with a project that includes native modules.  The error message is often vague, and debugging can be challenging. The issue stems from inconsistencies or conflicts between the Expo Go app, the Expo CLI, and the underlying native code in Android or iOS. It might manifest as build failures, runtime crashes, or unexpected behavior within the app.  A common symptom is an error related to missing native libraries or linkage problems. For example: `Unable to resolve module ... from ...` or a similar message indicating a missing dependency in the native build process.  The problem can arise from issues such as incorrect native module configuration in `app.json` or `package.json`, version mismatches between dependencies, incorrect native code implementations, or problems with the Expo build system itself.
